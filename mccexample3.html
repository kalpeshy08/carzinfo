<h1><b>Renault Kwid</b></h1>
<p>The Renault Kwid is a crossover city car[3] produced by the French car manufacturer Renault, initially intended for the Indian market and launched in 2015.[4][5][6] In 2017, an improved Brazilian version was introduced for Latin American markets. Its battery electric version, named Renault City K-ZE, was launched in 2019, being manufactured in China and exported to Europe since 2021 as Dacia Spring Electric and to Latin America since 2022 as Renault Kwid E-Tech.</p>
<h2><b>History</b></h2>
<p>The Kwid was developed under the project code BBA. It is the first car to be based on the new CMF-A platform jointly developed by Renault and Nissan.[4] It is slightly longer but narrower than Renault's smallest conventional vehicle, the Twingo[5] with a high sitting position and a 180 mm (7.1 in) ride height.

The car was designed by an engineers' team settled in India led by Gérard Detourbet, a senior engineer, former mathematician described as "an innovation a minute" who led the development team for the first-generation Dacia Logan.[7]

The Kwid was unveiled at Chennai on 20 May 2015 by Renault's CEO Carlos Ghosn.[5] Ghosn said the car would be "a game changer for Renault in India." The car has 98 per cent of parts localisation and extensive engineering by local Renault's personnel.[8][9] The Kwid is aimed at competing with other small cars within the Indian market, as the Suzuki Alto,[4] and incorporates uncommon equipment for its segment such as a digital instrument cluster and a multimedia touchscreen.

In September 2015, the Kwid was launched in India at a starting price of 257,000 rupees,[10] equal to $3,884. Sales started in September and had a "flying start" of 25,000 bookings in 2 weeks and 50,000 in 5 weeks,[11][12] then 70,000 in 2 months, getting 10% of effective market shares in its segment.[13][14] The Indian version is exported to various overseas markets such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Tunisia and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h2><b>Specifications</b></h2>
<p>At launch, the only engine available was a three-cylinder, 799 cc unit with a 40 kW (54 hp) power output and 72 N⋅m (53 lb⋅ft) torque, coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission. According to the Indian newspaper The Financial Express, Kwid's 300-litre boot space is "the most voluminous in its class" and its fuel efficiency is "class-leading", at 59.2 mpg‑US; 3.973 l/100 km (25.17 km/L).[15] In August 2016, the Kwid received a more powerful 1.0-liter engine.[16] The Kwid 1.0 is powered by a 999 cc engine which churns out 50 kW (67 hp) of power and 91 N⋅m (67 lb⋅ft) of peak torque.[17]

The Renault Kwid received a minor update in July 2018. It gets new features such as pretensioner front seat-belts, two additional USB sockets, a rear armrest, a new grille and two new colour schemes. The Dacia Easy-R 5-speed automated manual transmission became available on Indian market Kwid models.[18]</p>
<h2><b>Safety</b></h2>
<p>The Kwid is equipped with rear drum brakes.[23][24]

At tests conducted in 2016, the Indian version of the Kwid with no ABS scored a 0-star rating for adult occupants and 2 stars for infants from Global NCAP, a rating also achieved by many entry-level competitors in the Indian market, including localised versions of the Suzuki Alto, the Hyundai Eon, the Tata Nano, the Suzuki Celerio and the Ford Figo.[25] The Kwid was also criticised for being one of the Indian models not having airbags as standard. Renault and other car manufacturers made objections to Global NCAP for its methodology and for ignoring India's own safety criteria,[26] complaints also made in other regions as the NCAPs try to raise the safety level beyond that prescribed by the local regulators, which corresponds to 0-stars. One version with driver airbag obtained 1 star for adult occupants but also 1 star for infants the same year.[27] A two-airbag version for Africa was tested in 2020 and obtained 2 stars for both (similar to Latin NCAP 2013).[28]

The Brazilian-built Kwid in its most basic Latin American configuration with 4 airbags and no ESC got a 3-star rating from Latin NCAP in 2017,[29] which corresponds to a now obsolete but already one level more strict protocol than the one used by Global NCAP before H2 2022.</p>
