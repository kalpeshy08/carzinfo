        <p>
            A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving and racing capability. <br>
            Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1902 and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.<br>
            Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance, without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. <br>
            Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity",[4] or that emphasise the "thrill of driving"[5] or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track"[6] However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater"[7] or a car with two seats only<br>
            In the United Kingdom, early recorded usage of the "sports car" was in The Times newspaper in 1919.[10] The first known use of the term in the United States was in 1928.[8] Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.[11] The term was originally used for two-seat roadsters (cars without a fixed roof), however, since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with a fixed roof (which were previously considered grand tourers).<br>
