	<h1>Renault Twizy</h1>
	<p>The Renault Twizy is a two-seat electric microcar designed and marketed by Renault. It is classified in Europe as either a light or heavy quadricycle depending on the output power, which is either 4 kW (5.4 hp) for the 45 model or 13 kW (17 hp) for the 80 model, both names reflecting its top speed in km/h. Originally manufactured in Valladolid, Spain,[4][5] production was moved to Busan in South Korea in March 2019 to meet increased demand in Asia.[6] In July 2023 it was announced that production of the Twizy was to end in September 2023; it is to be replace by the new Mobilize Duo.[7]


The 2009 concept
The Twizy debuted as a concept car at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show[8] and was designed by Françoise Leboinne and Luciano Bove. In November 2010, Nissan announced a rebadged variant to the Twizy, called the New Mobility Concept, or NMC. It was also displayed as a concept with Renault Samsung badging at the 2011 Seoul Motor Show,[9] although it was branded as a Renault in South Korea for production. In May 2011, Renault announced they would produce the Twizy and began taking reservations.

In March 2012, the Twizy was released to the French market, followed a month later by several other European countries.[10] Available in three models, the Twizy sales price does not include the battery pack, which is leased for a monthly fee that includes roadside assistance and a battery replacement guarantee.[11][12] In 2020 the Twizy became available as a direct purchase in the UK, no longer requiring the battery rental.[13]

The Twizy was the top-selling plug-in electric vehicle in Europe during 2012.[14] The milestone of 15,000 Twizys sold worldwide was achieved in April 2015.[15] Global cumulative sales totaled 29,118 units through December 2019, with Europe as its main market.[16]</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<h3><b>Construction and safety</b></h3>
<p>The Twizy is an ultra-compact vehicle, with a length of 2.32 metres (7 ft 7 in), a width of 1.19 metres (3 ft 11 in) and a height of 1.46 metres (4 ft 9 in).

The vehicle's frame and body offer occupants extra protection with its deformable structure, while the outboard position of the four wheels and the lateral beams located either side of the chassis provide protection in case of a side impact. The safety retention systems include a driver's airbag, a four-point safety belt at the front and a three-point one at the rear.

The Twizy may be winterized with winter tires and adding flexi side windows to enclose the cabin. Heating would be provided by plugging in electric blankets to keep the driver warm.</p>
<h3><b>Models</b></h3>
<p>The Twizy model is electric, and it therefore is part of Renault's Zero Emissions program.</p>
<h3><b>Twizy Urban 45</b></h3>
<p>The Twizy range starts with the light quadricycle-classed Urban 45 that was originally priced at €6,990 in Europe with a monthly battery lease charge of €50.[18] The price has since been raised to around €10,300 exc. VAT but now includes the battery.[19] It has a motor power of 4 kW (5 hp), a maximum speed of 45 km/h (28 mph) and can thus be driven in most European countries by drivers from 14 years old with a special driving licence (France, Italy, Spain) or with a moped licence (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Slovenia).</p>
