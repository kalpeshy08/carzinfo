The grand tourer coupe has landed on Indian shores and Aston hopes that the DB11 will help them double their sales figures from last year. The DB11 also marks a new age in Aston Martin history with it being the first ever Aston to get a turbocharger for its mill.</p><p>The signature Aston Martin looks with the gaping crown-like grille and feline headlamps makes it look racy. The LED signature daylight running lamps, the long hood with its sculpted lines and vents looks sporty especially with the car being low slung. The profile reveals the aerodynamic contours as the car tapers towards the back, especially the cabin. The wheel arches are wide and house the large 21-inch wheels with chunky tyre treads making it look hunkered down. The tail is sharp but contoured and the kinked LED tail lamps blend perfectly with the flowing roofline.</p><p>Inside, the new grand tourer from the British car maker is all about luxury. The leather is exquisite and the bucket-racing seats are super comfortable thanks to the thick cushioning. The binnacle of the instrument cluster is actually a digital screen that changes the information according to your needs and driving modes. You also have a touch-screen music system, detailing on the touch-points and door sill, power seats et al to make you comfortable.</p><p>The DB11 is powered by the brand new 5.2-litre turbocharged V12 petrol engine and is the first Aston to take the force induction route to performance. The 600bhp and 700Nm torque engine is mated to an eight-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox powers the right set of wheels. The DB11 zooms past 100kmph in 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 323kmph.</p><p>In terms of safety, there is a web of airbags keeping you unharmed from all directions in addition to an elaborate stability program replete with active suspension, steering response and engine response. It also gets driving aids like traction control, ABS with EBD, hill-hold function et al.</p><p>At the Rs 4 crore plus price tag (ex-showroom), it competes with the Lamborghini Huracan, the Ferrari California and the Bentley Continental GT.</p></div></div></div></div><div aria-label="Read More" aria-expanded="false" role="button" class="o-frwuxB  o-eqqVmt o-eemiLE o-cHfWwD o-fyWCgU o-fzoTov o-elzeOy" data-skin="expand-collapse-btn">Read More</div></div></div></div></section></div></div><div><div class=""><div><div></div></div></div></div><div class=""><div class="o-ItVGT o-bIMsfE o-GFmfi o-dgwiHy o-eKWNKE o-fBNTVC o-fzptZB o-czsMOo o-fzpibK o-cOtEaW o-fznJzu o-bNAfCw o-fznJPk o-eqYUlK o-eNbQSA o-deKpZW  o-brXWGL"><a href="/car-loan/?origin=1&amp;pageId=31&amp;propertyId=57&amp;newPageId=1" title="Car loan offers" class="o-cpnuEd"><div class="o-chOnzP yLOsXj o-fzpibr"><div class="o-bqHweY o-bfyaNx o-brXWGL dGcAoR "><img class="o-bXKmQE o-cgkaRG o-cQfblS o-bNxxEB o-pGqQl o-wBtSi o-bwUciP o-btTZkL o-bfyaNx o-eAZqQI" src="https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif" alt="Car loan offers" title="Car loan offers" data-src="https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/cw/static/icons/svg/tools/car-loans-02.svg"/></div></div><div class="o-fzpimR" data-skin="text"><div class="o-jjpuv o-dqVwuv o-eqqVmt o-eZTujG">Need a Car Loan?</div><div class="o-eqqVmt o-elzeOy o-fzpihx o-eemiLE">Apply to get Instant Pre-qualified Offers</div></div></a></div></div><div data-sectionhash="expert_opinion"><div class=""><section as="section" label="cw_take" data-lang-id="carwale_take_widget" class="o-fzptVd o-fzptYr o-brXWGL o-fBNTVC o-fznVme o-siHiz o-bOpJkN  o-edUBXX" data-skin="section"><div class="o-cpnuEd o-bUVylL o-dsiSgT o-fznJDS o-czsMOo o-fznJFI o-cOtEaW"><header class="o-fzoHFO o-ckGLSv o-fzoHCA o-fzpihY o-fzfPNY o-fzpilm o-brXWGL o-bfyaNx"><h2>How is the Aston Martin DB11 car?</h2></header><div></div></div><div class="o-fzoHFO o-fzoHCA o-fzpihY o-fzfPNY o-fzpilm o-dMxCbi o-brXWGL "><div class="o-fznJPk o-eqYUlK"><ul class="o-czsMOo o-cOtEaW o-bsCSvY o-efHQCX o-bklwfk"><li class="o-dueWSB o-fznJPp o-bifPsq o-cglRxs o-fznJDS o-ckGLSv o-fznJFI o-cMwvCl"><div class="o-cYOpxG o-eKWNKE o-fznJzu o-fzptZB o-fzptOP o-fznVCp o-evQsDB o-bCRRBE o-GFmfi o-bIMsfE o-ItVGT o-bfyaNx o-dNhQyk"><svg class="o-dlrcWp o-eoatGj o-cqgkZn o-euTeMg o-bfWOPh o-bJvRsk o-dpJDRU" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentcolor" tabindex="-1" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="img"></svg><h3 class="o-fzpimR o-eZTujG o-jjpuv o-cKuOoN o-fznJPk o-bLCYhJ">Pros</h3><div class="o-bkmzIL o-cpNAVm o-fznJDS o-fzoTtm o-chNNuk Kg7rlh jXxHPq"><ul><li>Stunning design</li><li>Powerful V12 motor</li><li>Superb ride and handling</li></ul></div></div></li><li class=" o-cglRxs o-fznJDS o-ckGLSv o-fznJFI o-cMwvCl"><div class="o-cYOpxG o-eKWNKE o-fznJzu o-fzptZB o-fzptOP o-fznVCp o-evQsDB o-bCRRBE o-GFmfi o-bIMsfE o-ItVGT o-bfyaNx o-dNhQyk"><svg class="o-dlrcWp o-eoatGj o-cqgkZn o-euTeMg o-bfWOPh o-bJvRsk o-eHYGXm sxUd3L" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentcolor" tabindex="-1" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="img"></svg><h3 class="o-fzpimR o-eZTujG o-jjpuv o-cKuOoN o-fznJPk o-bLCYhJ">Cons</h3><div class="o-bkmzIL o-cpNAVm o-fznJDS o-fzoTtm o-chNNuk Kg7rlh jXxHPq"><ul><li>Restricted rear-seat space</li><li>Stiff ride</li><li>Expensive</li></ul></div></div></li></ul></div><div class=" o-fznJEv o-cDkiVh o-fznJFh o-cJEFgL o-fzoHAP"><div class="o-cpnuEd o-bUVylL o-dsiSgT o-fzpilz"><h3 class="o-jjpuv o-dqVwuv o-eqqVmt ">Aston Martin DB11 2023 Verdict</h3><div></div></div><div class="o-fzpihx  o-YCHtV o-dbKqqe TaeHAC"><div line="0"><div class=" o-bfyaNx o-bNxxEB o-bqHweY" style="transition:max-height linear 0ms;max-height:46px;-webkit-line-clamp:unset"><div><div class="o-bkmzIL o-cyHybq o-fyWCgU"><p>The Aston Martin DB11 has a distinctive and lustful design that stands out from any other car in its class.

The grand tourer coupe has landed on Indian shores and Aston hopes that the DB11 will help them double their sales figures from last year. The DB11 also marks a new age in Aston Martin history with it being the first ever Aston to get a turbocharger for its mill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe signature Aston Martin looks with the gaping crown-like grille and feline headlamps makes it look racy. The LED signature daylight running lamps, the long hood with its sculpted lines and vents looks sporty especially with the car being low slung. The profile reveals the aerodynamic contours as the car tapers towards the back, especially the cabin. The wheel arches are wide and house the large 21-inch wheels with chunky tyre treads making it look hunkered down. The tail is sharp but contoured and the kinked LED tail lamps blend perfectly with the flowing roofline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInside, the new grand tourer from the British car maker is all about luxury. The leather is exquisite and the bucket-racing seats are super comfortable thanks to the thick cushioning. The binnacle of the instrument cluster is actually a digital screen that changes the information according to your needs and driving modes. You also have a touch-screen music system, detailing on the touch-points and door sill, power seats et al to make you comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe DB11 is powered by the brand new 5.2-litre turbocharged V12 petrol engine and is the first Aston to take the force induction route to performance. The 600bhp and 700Nm torque engine is mated to an eight-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox powers the right set of wheels. The DB11 zooms past 100kmph in 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 323kmph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of safety, there is a web of airbags keeping you unharmed from all directions in addition to an elaborate stability program replete with active suspension, steering response and engine response.
