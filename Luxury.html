        <h1>LUXURY</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Luxury cars are passenger automobiles built by recognized luxury automakers. Though this seems like a reflexive definition, it draws a line between luxury models made by mainstream brands and entry-level models built by luxury brands. The generally accepted list of luxury brands includes Acura, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, BMW, Bugatti, Cadillac, Ferrari, Genesis, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lamborghini, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Lotus, Maserati, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Tesla, and Volvo.</li>

            <li>Defining a luxury car was once an easy task when there were a select few brands available. Today, automakers known for their economy car lines are getting into the luxury market and blurring the lines for many looking for an upscale ride. Fortunately, there are a few characteristics that true luxury cars share, no matter which carmaker produces them.</li>

            <li>These traits are focused solely on the comfort and image of the driver. Luxury cars convey high class with elegant looks and unique features. From powerful engines to cutting-edge technology to lavish amenities, many of these cars have the latest features to make your drive convenient, comfortable, and unforgettable.</li>

            <li>Luxury car makers use high-quality parts, including expensive interior materials. Driving pleasure and cabin comfort are the key ingredients. The luxury car specs will show that all the carâ€™s details are high-end, not just a feature or two.</li>

            <li>The driving experience should be one of the most prominent differences between mainstream car brands and luxury marques. People buy luxury cars to feel rich, pampered, and prestigious.
