       		<u> <h1> The Range Rover </h1></u>
       		<p> The Range Rover is a 4x4 luxury SUV produced by Land Rover, a marque and sub-brand of Jaguar Land Rover.<br> The Range Rover line was launched in 1970 by British Leyland and is now in its fifth generation.<br>
        		Additional models have been launched under the Range Rover name, including <u>the Range Rover Sport</u>, <u>Range Rover Evoque,</u> and <u>Range Rover Velar.</u>

        	<h2> History</h2>
       			 The Rover Company (originator of the Land Rover marque) was experimenting with a larger model than the Land Rover Series in 1951, when the Rover P4-based two-wheel-drive "Road Rover" project was developed by Gordon Bashford.<br> This was shelved in 1958 and the idea lay dormant until 1966, when engineers Spen King and Bashford set to work on a new model<br>
        		 The first Range Rover prototype was built in 1967 with plate number SYE 157F

       			<li>a "clamshell" bonnet, 22 inch alloys, a 289 km/h (180 mph) top speed, 4WD and a 2,500 kg (5,512 lb) weight.</li>
       			<li>The Range Rover Sport was comparably of much more conservative design featuring five doors and a wheelbase hardly shorter than that of the Range Rover Vogue. </li>
       			<li>This allegedly gives the Range Rover Sport the refinement and structural rigidity advantages of a monocoque chassis with the robustness of a separate chassis design for off-road applications</li>
       			<li>It also allows for less expensive manufacturing of the vehicles due to a large number of common components.</li>
     			<li>ervice Bulletins for most 05-09 models have 2 types of brakes listed</li>
