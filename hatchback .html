        <u><h1>What is  Hatchback?</h1></u>
        <ul>
            <li>A hatchback is a car body configuration with a rear doorthat swings upward to provide access to the main interior of the car as a cargo area rather than just to a separated trunk. </li>
            <li>Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second-row seating, where the interior can be reconfigured to prioritize passenger or cargo volume.</li>
            <li>The distinguishing feature of a hatchback is a rear door that opens upwards[6] and is hinged at roof level (as opposed to the boot/trunk lid of a saloon/sedan, which is hinged below the rear window). </li>
            <li>Most hatchbacks use a two-box design body style,[7][8] where the cargo area (trunk/boot) and passenger areas are a single volume. The rear seats can often be folded down to increase the available cargo area.[</li>
            <li>Hatchbacks may have a removable rigid parcel shelf,[10] or flexible roll-up tonneau cover to cover the cargo space behind the rear seats.</li>
            <li>When describing the body style, the hatch is often counted as a door, therefore a hatchback with two passenger doors is called a three-door and a hatchback with four passenger doors is called a five-door.[10][11]


            </li>
            <li>Some hatchbacks are notchback three box designs, bearing a resemblance to sedans/saloons from a styling perspective, but being closer to hatchbacks in functionality by having a tailgate hinged from the roof.</li>
            <li>"Liftback" is a term for hatchback models in which the rear cargo door or hatch is more horizontally angled than on an average hatchback, and as a result, the hatch is lifted more upwards than backward, to open.</li>
            <li>The term was first used by Toyota in 1973, to describe the Toyota Celica Liftback GT.</li>
            <li>one of which was a conventional 5-door hatchback with a nearly vertical rear hatch while the other one was a 5-door more horizontal hatch, for which the term Liftback was used.</li>
