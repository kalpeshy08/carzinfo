		<h1>What Is Sedans</h1>
		<p>
			Profiles of a sedan, station wagon and hatchback versions of the same model (a Ford Focus)
<br>			A sedan is a car with a closed body (i.e. a fixed metal roof) with the engine, passengers, and cargo in separate compartments. This broad definition <br>			does not differentiate sedans from various other car body styles, but in practice, the typical characteristics of sedans are:
<br>
		</p>
			<ul>

				<li>B-pillar (between the front and rear windows) that supports the roof
					two rows of seats.</li> 
				<li>three-box design with the engine at the front and the cargo area at the rear,</li>
				<li>less steeply sloping roofline than a coupé, which results in increased headroom for rear passengers and a less sporting appearance and
					a rear interior volume of at least 33 cu ft (0.93 m3).</li>
				<li>It is sometimes suggested that sedans must have four doors (to provide a simple distinction between sedans and two-door coupés); others state that a sedan can have four or two doors. While the sloping rear roofline defined the coupe, the design element has become common on many body styles with manufacturers increasingly "cross-pollinating" the style so that terms such as sedan and coupé have been loosely interpreted as "'four-door coupes' - an inherent contradiction in terms.<li>

				<li>When a manufacturer produces two-door sedan and four-door sedan versions of the same model, the shape and position of the greenhouse on both versions may be identical, with only the B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions.</li>
