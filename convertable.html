        <u><h1>What is Convertable?</h1></u>
        <ul>
           <li>A convertible car's design allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required.</li>
           <li>A potential drawback of convertibles is their reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car's roof)</li>
           <li>The majority of convertible roofs are of a folding construction framework with the actual top made from cloth or other fabric.</li>
           <li>Most of the early automobiles were open-air vehicles without any roof or sides.</li>
           <li>As car engines became more powerful by the end of the 19th century, folding textile or leather roofs (as had been used on victoria or landau carriages) began to appear on cars</li>
           <li>In the 1920s, when steel bodies began to be mass-produced, closed cars became available to the average buyer, and fully open cars began to disappear from the mainstream market. By the mid 1930s, the remaining small number of convertibles sold were high-priced luxury models</li>
           <li> In 1939, Plymouth introduced the first mechanically operated convertible roof powered by two vacuum cylinders.</li>
           <li>Demand for convertibles increased as a result of American soldiers in France and the United Kingdom during World War 2 experiencing the small roadster cars that were not available in the United States at the time.</li>
           <li>Early convertibles used cotton canvas woven so tightly that it is waterproof. Automakers had problems in securing raw materials to fulfill orders after World War II, including canvas in various shades for convertible tops, therefore limiting their manufacture.</li>
